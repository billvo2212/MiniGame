/* This file includes:
 * 	1. Solution to P3
 *  2. Questions for P4. Comments starting with REQ represent the questions.
 *  
 * Features:
 * 	- We have from 1 to 3 players
 *  - We have many questions. Each player may be asked more than one question.
 *  - User can play many rounds of the game. 
 * 
 * Focus: 
 * 	- Arrays and Methods

 * Aim:
 * 	- Organize code and avoid code redundancy by the use of methods

			// 		  Assume that an incorrectly answered question will keep popping up until it is correctly answered or we finish all the rounds.
